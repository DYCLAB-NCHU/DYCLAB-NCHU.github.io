I am a bioinformatician specializing in transcriptomics and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. My expertises extend to Nanopore sequencing (a form of Third-Generation Sequencing, TGS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and Spatial Transcriptomics (ST). My training at an epidemiology institute influenced my research approach and emphasize rigorous study design and analytical methodologies.

Throughout my career, I've dominant several projects focusing on viral transcriptomics, viral genomics and its phylogenetics, and host transcriptomic responses to viral infections. These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how to dealing with and integrate different data types and methodologies to address complex biological questions.

As I near the completion of my Ph.D., I owe a debt of gratitude to two mentors who have significantly shaped my journey. [Dr. Day-Yu Chao](https://dyclab-nchu.github.io) has been instrumental in guiding me through the challenges of the biological sciences. His support in transitioning me to dry lab work and encouraging independent thinking has been invaluable. I admire his flexibility in thought and his fearless approach to research.Additionally, [Dr. James J Cai](https://cailab-tamu.github.io) introduced me to the world of scRNA-seq and has been a constant source of support as I pursued opportunities in the United States. His dedication to his work and commitment to student mentorship are qualities I greatly respect and strive to emulate in my own career.


<!-- Dr. Neema Mduma is a computer scientist and senior lecturer at the [Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST)](https://www.nm-aist.ac.tz/index.php/neema) specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). She is the founder of an initiative called BakiShule which promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) to girls in secondary school in Tanzania. Dr. Mduma also serves as a Principal Investigator in various projects that use AI and ML to address challenges in agriculture, health, education, and other sectors. Additionally, she reviews for scientific journals and conferences and most recently she was appointed by the Minister of State, Presidentâ€™s Office Planning and Investment, as a member of the technical team for the Tanzania Development Vision 2050. -->
